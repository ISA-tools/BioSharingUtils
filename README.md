**BioSharing Utils**

A number of tools which make it possible to perform automatic updates of content in BioSharing. At present the tool provides the ability to do the following:

* add any new BioPortal ontologies to the database;
* add publications to current standards semi-automatically; and
* scan current standards and attempt to 'ontologise' the domains of those standards in an attempt to standardise them. 

More work will follow on this, however the current design of the package allows for relatively easy additions of new 'tasks' within the tool. It has a command line interface to provide users with an easy way to access and run particular tasks.
